		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>This assignment implemented a comprehensive cloth simulation that models fabric physics through a sophisticated 
			mass-spring system. The project encompassed creating a complex numerical integration approach to simulate cloth 
			movement, with detailed collision detection for interactions with objects like spheres and planes, and advanced 
			self-collision prevention using spatial hashing techniques.</p>
		<p>The most compelling aspect of the implementation was how it combined multiple computational domains: physics
			simulation, geometric collision detection, and advanced computer graphics rendering. By implementing vertex and
			fragment shaders using the Blinn-Phong lighting model, the project achieved highly realistic cloth visualization
			with techniques like texture and displacement mapping.</p>
		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>

		<p>The function begins by clearing any existing point masses and springs to ensure a fresh grid construction. It then 
			creates a grid of point masses by iterating through all height and width points of the cloth. For each point, it 
			calculates a position based on the cloth's orientation - if horizontal, it positions points along the x and z axes
			with a fixed y-value of 1.0; if vertical, it positions points along the x and y axes with a small random z offset 
			to prevent coplanarity issues. The function checks each point against a list of pinned coordinates to determine if 
			it should be fixed in place, then adds each point mass to the collection. After creating all point masses, the
			function establishes three types of springs: structural springs connecting immediate horizontal and vertical 
			neighbors, shearing springs connecting diagonal neighbors, and bending springs connecting every other point in 
			horizontal and vertical directions. These different spring types allow the cloth to realistically resist various 
			deformations while maintaining flexibility. The index for each point mass is calculated based on its position in the
			grid using the formula y * num_width_points + x, which efficiently converts 2D coordinates to a 1D array index.</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<p>The cloth simulation calculates mass for each point and the time step from frame rate. It first resets all forces, 
			then applies external accelerations like gravity to each point mass. Spring forces are calculated using Hooke's law,
			with different handling for structural, shearing, and bending springs. Connected point masses experience equal and
			opposite forces based on the deviation from rest length. Bending springs use a reduced spring constant for
			flexibility. Position updates follow Verlet integration, accounting for previous position, current forces, and 
			damping effects, while pinned points remain stationary. To prevent unrealistic stretching, a constraint limits 
			spring extension to no more than 10% beyond rest length in any timestep (following Provot's method). This constraint
			correction is applied proportionally between connected points, with adjustments made based on whether points are
			fixed or movable.</p>
		<p>Spring Constant ks: As the spring constant (ks) increases, the cloth becomes stiffer and appears flatter. This 
			happens because a higher spring constant means the spring exerts more force to return to its resting length, 
			making the cloth less flexible and more resistant to bending or folding. On the other hand, when the spring 
			constant is smaller, the cloth is more flexible and can move more freely. It can bend and fold with greater ease 
			due to the reduced force exerted by the spring to return to its original shape.

		<p>Density: The lower the density, the stiffer the cloth. At lower densities, the cloth has a lower mass, which results
			in smaller forces acting on the cloth. As the density increases, the cloth becomes more flexible and can bend and 
			fold more easily. This is because the cloth has a higher mass, which results in larger forces acting on the cloth.
			This can be explained by Newton's 2nd Law, which states F=ma. With lower density, the cloth's smaller mass leads to 
			greater acceleration, making it stiffer. Higher density increases the mass, reducing acceleration and allowing the 
			cloth to bend and fold more easily, making it more flexible.

		<p>Damping: When the damping is at 0%, the cloth swings back and forth rapidly, which never reaches a state of rest. 
			There is no force opposing the motion of the cloth, so it continues to swing back and forth. When the damping is 
			at 1%, the cloth comes to a state of rest more quickly. This is because damping is a force that opposes the motion 
			of the cloth. The force opposing the motion is greater, so the cloth comes to a state of rest more quickly.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>Sphere Collision: When handling collisions with spheres, the code first calculates the direction vector from the 
			sphere's origin to the point mass's current position. It then finds the distance between these points. If this 
			distance is less than or equal to the sphere's radius, a collision has occurred. To resolve the collision, the code
			 calculates a tangent point on the sphere's surface directly along the direction vector. It then creates a correction 
			 vector from the point mass's current position to this tangent point. Finally, the point mass's position is updated 
			 by applying this correction vector to its last position, scaled by a factor of (1.0 - friction) to simulate friction
			effects during collision.
		</p>

		<p>Plane Collision: For plane collisions, the code calculates the signed distances from the point mass's last position 
			and current position to the plane. These distances indicate which side of the plane the point mass was on and is 
			currently on. If the signs of these distances match (their product is positive), the point mass hasn't crossed the 
			plane and no collision occurred. If the signs differ, a collision has happened. In this case, the code calculates 
			the intersection point where the point mass crossed the plane by linear interpolation. It then creates a correction 
			vector from the point mass's current position to this intersection point, with a small offset (SURFACE_OFFSET) added
			 along the plane's normal direction to prevent numerical issues. Finally, like with sphere collisions, the point 
			 mass's position is updated by applying this correction vector to its last position, scaled by (1.0 - friction).</p>

		<p>To handle the collisions, Cloth::simulate gets updated. For each point mass, the inner loop iterates through all 
			collision objects (obj) in the collision_objects collection. These collision objects could be spheres, planes, or 
			other geometric shapes that the cloth might interact with. Inside the inner loop, the code calls the collide() 
			method on each collision object, passing the current point mass as an argument. This polymorphic call invokes the 
			appropriate collision handling logic based on the specific type of collision object (sphere, plane, etc.). The 
			collide() method, as seen in the previous code snippets, will check if the point mass has collided with the object
			 and, if so, adjust the point mass's position to resolve the collision while applying friction effects. </p>

		<p>As the spring stiffness parameter (ks) increases from 500 to 50000, there are notable changes in how the cloth 
			behaves when draped over the sphere. With the lowest stiffness value (ks = 500), the cloth appears significantly 
			more pliable and flexible, conforming closely to the sphere's shape while creating deeper, more pronounced folds 
			and wrinkles. The edges hang lower with dramatic draping, resembling a soft, flowing fabric like silk or light 
			cotton. When ks increases to the default value of 5000, the cloth exhibits a moderate level of stiffness, 
			maintaining some natural-looking vertical folds while still conforming to the sphere, but with less dramatic draping
			than the lowest setting. The cloth hangs with a balanced, natural curve around the edges. As ks further increases 
			to 50000, the cloth becomes remarkably stiffer, showing significantly fewer folds and wrinkles. It appears to hover
			more above the sphere rather than fully conforming to its shape, and the bottom edges form much shallower arcs.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>For Cloth::hash_position, I created a spatial hashing function that converts 3D positions into unique float 
			identifiers. This function divides the 3D space into box volumes by calculating cell dimensions based on the cloth's
			properties. The width of each cell is three times the width of a point mass, and similarly for height. For depth, I 
			use the maximum of these two values. I then quantize the position by removing the remainder when divided by the cell
			 dimensions, effectively snapping the position to a grid. Finally, I compute a unique hash value using the formula
			x + y * w + z * w * h, which creates a distinct identifier for each 3D box in the spatial grid.
		</p>
		<p>In Cloth::build_spatial_map, I construct a spatial data structure to efficiently detect potential collisions. The 
			function first clears any existing map entries, releasing previous memory. Then, for each point mass in the cloth, 
			I hash its position using the hash_position function. If the resulting hash value doesn't exist in the map, I create
			 a new vector to store point masses at that location. Finally, I add the current point mass pointer to the
			  appropriate vector in the map. This spatial map groups nearby point masses together, significantly reducing the 
			  number of collision checks needed.</p>
		<p>For Cloth::self_collide, I implement the actual collision response for each point mass. The function begins by 
			retrieving potential collision candidates from the spatial map using the point mass's position hash. For each 
			candidate point mass in the same spatial cell, I check if they're too close by computing the distance between them.
			 If the distance is less than twice the cloth thickness (indicating overlap), I calculate a correction vector to 
			 push them apart. The function accumulates all correction vectors and then applies the average correction, scaled 
			 by the simulation steps, to the point mass's position. This approach effectively prevents cloth self-penetration 
			 while distributing the collision response evenly.</p>
		<p>The last thing to do is to update Cloth::simulate, which is to first build the spatial map. Next, I iterate the
			point masses and call self_collide on the point mass and the simulation steps.</p>

		<p>Density: The higher the density, the cloth has more mass, which causes it to fall faster and create new gaps

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<p>A shader program is a fundamental component in computer graphics rendering that allows for sophisticated visual 
			effects by manipulating how 3D objects are drawn on the screen. At its core, a shader program consists of two 
			primary types of shaders: vertex shaders and fragment shaders, which work together to transform and color each 
			pixel of a rendered image.</p>
		<p>A vertex shader operates first in the rendering pipeline, processing each vertex (corner point) of a 3D model. 
			Its primary responsibilities include transforming the 3D coordinates of vertices from their original model space 
			to screen space, applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and translation. This shader can also manipulate
			 vertex attributes such as color, texture coordinates, and normal vectors, which are crucial for determining how 
			 light will interact with the surface.</p>
		<p>The fragment shader takes over after the vertex shader and works on a pixel-by-pixel basis. It determines the final 
			color of each pixel on the rendered surface. Using the information passed from the vertex shader, such as transformed
			 vertex positions, normal vectors, and texture coordinates, the fragment shader applies complex lighting 
			 calculations, texture mapping, and material properties. This is where sophisticated visual effects like reflections,
			shadows, specular highlights, and complex material textures are implemented.</p>
		<p>Together, these shaders create a powerful system for rendering graphics. The vertex shader prepares the geometric
			structure and initial lighting information, while the fragment shader uses that information to create the final
			visual appearance. This collaborative process allows for incredibly realistic and dynamic rendering of 3D graphics in 
			video games, simulations, and other computer-generated visual environments.</p>

		<p>The Blinn-Phong shading model is a fundamental technique in computer graphics for approximating how light interacts
			 with surfaces, improving upon the earlier Phong reflection model. It breaks down surface illumination into three 
			 key components, each with its distinct equation:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Ambient Lighting Equation:</strong> <code>I_a = k_a * L_a</code>
				<p>This represents the base, uniform illumination that exists everywhere in a scene, ensuring that objects are 
					never completely dark. Here, k_a is the ambient reflection coefficient, and L_a is the ambient light 
					intensity.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>Diffuse Lighting Equation:</strong> <code>I_d = k_d * (L_d * max(N · L, 0))</code>
				<p>Diffuse reflection captures how light scatters uniformly across a matte surface, depending on the angle 
					between the light source and the surface normal. The dot product (N · L) determines how directly the light 
					hits the surface, with max() ensuring no negative values.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>Specular Lighting Equation:</strong> <code>I_s = k_s * (L_s * max(N · H, 0)^n)</code>
				<p>The specular component calculates the sharp, bright highlights that appear when light reflects almost 
					directly into the viewer's eye. H is the halfway vector between light and view directions, N is the surface 
					normal, L_s is specular light intensity, k_s is the specular reflection coefficient, and n is the shininess
					exponent controlling highlight size.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The complete Blinn-Phong lighting equation combines these components:</p>
		
		<code>L = I_a + I_d + I_s</code>
		
		<p>Or in its full form:</p>
		
		<code>L = k_a * L_a + k_d * (L_d * max(N · L, 0)) + k_s * (L_s * max(N · H, 0)^n)</code>

		<p>Bump Mapping</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>
			<strong>16x16 Mesh:</strong> The bump-mapped sphere appears smooth overall, with the brick texture simulated 
			through changes in surface shading. The low resolution of the mesh limits the detail, and the illusion of depth is 
			entirely dependent on lighting.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			<strong>128x128 Mesh:</strong> The bump mapping remains consistent in appearance, as it does not modify the 
			geometry of the mesh. The higher resolution does not significantly improve the perceived depth since bump mapping 
			only alters surface normals for shading.
		  </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Displacement Mapping</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>
			<strong>16x16 Mesh:</strong> The displacement-mapped sphere shows noticeable geometric deformation, but the low 
			resolution results in a blocky and less detailed appearance. The brick pattern is visible but lacks refinement due 
			to the coarse mesh.
		  </li>

			<strong>128x128 Mesh:</strong> With a higher resolution, displacement mapping creates a much more detailed and 
			realistic effect. The geometry of the sphere is deformed to match the brick texture accurately, resulting in
			pronounced depth and a more natural appearance.

		</ul>
		
		<p>Key Observations: Bump mapping relies on shading tricks and does not modify geometry, so its effectiveness is 
			independent of mesh resolution. Displacement mapping physically alters the mesh geometry, so higher resolutions 
			significantly improve its realism and detail.</p>

		<h2>Extra Credit</h2>

		<p>For my custom shader, I combined texture mapping and mirror shading. Here's my implementation:</p>

		<p>The fragment shader implements a sophisticated rendering technique that combines multiple visual elements through a
			series of calculated steps. Beginning with normalized surface normals and light direction calculations, the shader
			computes diffuse lighting by evaluating the dot product between the normal and light vector. It samples a primary
			texture and a cubemap reflection texture, blending these colors to create depth and realism. A unique time-based
			procedural color generation adds dynamic variation, using trigonometric functions to create animated color shifts.
			The final color output combines diffuse lighting, texture colors, reflection, and procedural effects, resulting in 
			a rich, responsive surface that adapts to lighting conditions and temporal changes. This approach allows for complex
			visual rendering that goes beyond static texture mapping, introducing elements of dynamic lighting, environment
			reflection, and color animation in a single fragment shader implementation.</p>

		<p>I also added wind. The first thing I did was to add max_wind_strength, and wind variables in clothSimulator.h.
			In the clothSimulator, I initialized the wind strength to 0.0 and the wind direction to (0, 0, 0).
			In the drawContents method, I added the following things:</p>
		<p>First, a small random perturbation delta_wind is generated for each component (x, y, z) by scaling a random value
			in the range [-0.5, 0.5] by 0.1 * max_wind_strength. This perturbation is added to the existing wind vector.</p>
		<p>Next, if wind exceeds max_wind_strength, it is normalized and scaled back to the maximum allowed strength. Finally, 
			the total external acceleration is computed by summing the wind and gravity vectors, storing the result in 
			external_accelerations. This will get passed into simulate.</p>
		<p>The last thing that I did is to make a wind slider for the GUI, which is similar to damping.</p>
