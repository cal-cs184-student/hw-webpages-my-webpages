		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>In this assignment, I built a path tracer from the ground up, implementing a series of core components that are 
			essential for rendering realistic images using ray tracing. The project was divided into several key parts, each 
			building on the previous one to create a fully functional rendering system. Here's a high-level breakdown of what 
			was implemented:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Ray Generation and Scene Intersection
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Ray Generation:</strong> Converts screen coordinates into world-space rays based on camera 
						parameters.</li>
					<li><strong>Triangle Intersection:</strong> Uses the MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm to check for ray-triangle 
						intersections.</li>
					<li><strong>Sphere Intersection:</strong> Solves a quadratic equation to detect ray-sphere 
						intersections.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
	
			<li>Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)
				<ul>
					<li><strong>BVH Construction:</strong> Organizes primitives into a tree structure to speed up ray 
						intersections.</li>
					<li><strong>Performance Gains:</strong> Drastically reduces rendering times compared to brute-force 
						intersection tests.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
	
			<li>Direct Illumination
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Uniform Hemisphere Sampling:</strong> Distributes samples evenly across a hemisphere but 
						struggles with point lights.</li>
					<li><strong>Importance Sampling:</strong> Focuses samples on light sources, improving efficiency.</li>
					<li><strong>Soft Shadows:</strong> Increasing light rays per pixel reduces noise and improves shadow 
						quality.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
	
			<li>Global Illumination
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Recursive Path Tracing:</strong> Captures indirect light bounces to improve realism.</li>
					<li><strong>Russian Roulette Termination:</strong> Optimizes computation by probabilistically stopping 
						ray recursion.</li>
					<li><strong>Rendering Comparisons:</strong> Increasing samples per pixel and bounces enhances image 
						quality while reducing noise.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
	
			<li>Adaptive Sampling
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Per-Pixel Convergence Checking:</strong> Uses the variance of color values to determine when a 
						pixel has converged.</li>
					<li><strong>Efficiency Gains:</strong> Stops sampling pixels that have stabilized, reducing unnecessary
						 computations.</li>
					<li><strong>Final Image Quality:</strong> Balances rendering speed and quality by allocating more samples 
						to noisy areas.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>One of the most interesting aspects was adaptive sampling, which taught me how to balance rendering quality and
			efficiency by focusing computational resources on noisy or complex regions. This technique, along with acceleration 
			structures like BVH, dramatically reduced rendering times while maintaining high image quality. I also gained a 
			deeper appreciation for the trade-offs between sampling strategies (hemisphere vs. importance sampling) and the
			power of global illumination in creating realistic lighting. Overall, this project not only solidified my 
			understanding of path tracing but also inspired me to explore more advanced rendering techniques.</p>

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		<p>The ray generation process takes place in the Camera::generate_ray() method, which begins by handling normalized 
			screen coordinates and field of view angles. The method converts horizontal and vertical field of view angles from 
			degrees to radians, then calculates the sensor position using the tangent of half the field of view. This sensor 
			coordinate is then transformed to create a ray direction. The process continues with ray construction, where a ray
			originates from the camera position and the sensor position is transformed using the camera-to-world matrix. The 
			method sets minimum and maximum ray travel distances, and finally normalizes the sensor position to create a 
			direction vector.</p>
		<p>In the PathTracer::raytrace_pixel() method, multiple samples are generated for anti-aliasing purposes. The method 
			creates rays for each sample using the generate_ray() function, traces these rays through the scene, and averages
			the radiance contributions to produce the final pixel color.</p>
		<p>Triangle intersection is implemented using the Moller Trumbore Algorithm through two methods: has_intersection() and 
			intersect(). The algorithm begins with preliminary calculations that compute two edges of the triangle and calculate
			a perpendicular vector using the cross product of ray direction and one edge. Next, it computes the determinant by 
			taking the dot product of an edge and the perpendicular vector, checking if the ray is parallel to the triangle. 
			If not parallel, the algorithm proceeds to calculate barycentric coordinates using dot products and validates these
			coordinates are within acceptable ranges. Finally, it computes the intersection distance and checks if it falls
			within the ray's travel range.</p>
		<p>For sphere intersection, implemented in Sphere::test(), has_intersection(), and intersect(), the process involves
			setting up and solving a quadratic equation. The algorithm transforms the ray to the sphere's local space, computes
			the discriminant to determine if intersection occurs, and if positive, calculates two potential intersection
			distances. It then checks if these intersections fall within the ray's travel range. When using the intersect()
			method, additional details are calculated including the intersection point, surface normal, and information about
			the primitive and BSDF.</p>

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		<p>The BVH construction process, implemented in BVHAccel::construct_bvh(), begins by computing the overall bounding box
			for all primitives within the given range. This initial bounding box serves as the enclosing volume for the entire
			set of primitives. If the number of primitives is less than or equal to the max_leaf_size, a leaf node is created.
			This ensures that leaf nodes do not contain an excessive number of primitives, which helps maintain a balanced and
			efficient tree structure.</p>

		<p>A key heuristic in the algorithm involves computing the bounding box of the centroids of the primitives, rather than
			using their original bounding boxes. This centroid-based approach is crucial for determining how to split the
			primitives effectively. The algorithm then selects the axis with the longest extent in the centroid bounding box as
			the splitting axis. This heuristic ensures that the split is made along the dimension where the primitives are most
			spread out, which typically results in a more balanced subdivision of the space.</p>
			
		<p>Once the axis is chosen, the splitting point is determined as the midpoint of the selected axis within the centroid
			bounding box. The primitives are then partitioned using std::partition() based on whether their centroids lie to the
			left or right of this splitting point. To ensure balance, the algorithm checks if the partition results in an overly
			unbalanced split (e.g., all primitives on one side). If this occurs, it falls back to splitting the primitives
			exactly in the middle, regardless of their centroid positions. Finally, the algorithm recursively constructs the left
			and right subtrees, repeating the process until the BVH is fully built. This combination of centroid-based heuristics
			and balancing checks ensures an efficient and well-structured BVH.</p>

		<p>BVH acceleration significantly improves rendering times for scenes with moderately complex geometries. Without BVH, 
			ray tracing performs exhaustive checks on all objects, resulting in longer render times, especially for scenes 
			with many or intricate geometries. BVH speeds up the process by organizing the scene into bounding volumes,
			 allowing the renderer to quickly eliminate large portions of the scene that donât intersect the ray. This 
			 hierarchical structure reduces the number of intersection tests, often decreasing rendering times by an order 
			 of magnitude, depending on scene complexity and BVH quality. Overall, BVH is a critical optimization for more 
			 efficient rendering.</p>
		
	
		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>

		<p>Hemisphere Sampling in the estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere function works by uniformly sampling the hemisphere 
			around the hit point to find direct lighting. The process begins by establishing a coordinate system at the hit 
			point with the normal isect.n aligned with the Z direction, calculating the hit point position as 
			hit_p = r.o + r.d * isect.t, and transforming the outgoing direction into object space as w_out = w2o * (-r.d). 
			The number of samples is determined by multiplying the number of lights in the scene by the samples per light 
			(ns_area_light). For each sample, the function generates a random direction wi in the hemisphere using 
			hemisphereSampler->get_sample(), transforms this direction to world space with wi_world = o2w * wi, creates a ray 
			from the hit point in that direction, and tests for intersection with the scene using the BVH. When the ray 
			intersects an emissive object (light), the function calculates the BSDF value as f = isect.bsdf->f(w_out, wi), 
			determines the PDF for hemisphere sampling as pdf = 1.0 / (2.0 * PI), gets the emitted radiance as 
			Li = new_isect.bsdf->get_emission(), computes the contribution as f * Li * cos_theta(wi) / pdf, and adds this 
			contribution to the output radiance L_out. The final result is the average radiance, calculated by dividing L_out 
			by the number of samples.
		</p>

		<p>Importance Sampling in the estimate_direct_lighting_importance function takes a more efficient approach by sampling 
			directly from the lights in the scene, focusing samples where they matter most. Like hemisphere sampling, it starts
			by creating a coordinate system and computing the hit point and outgoing direction. The function then iterates 
			through each light in the scene, initializing a contribution accumulator L_light for each one. For delta lights, it
			takes just one sample, while for area lights, it takes multiple samples based on ns_area_light. In the sampling loop
			for each light, the function gets a point on the light and its emission using light->sample_L(), converts the world
			space direction to local coordinates with wi = w2o * wi_world, creates a shadow ray from the hit point toward the
			light, and tests for occlusion using the BVH. If no occlusion is found, it evaluates the BSDF as
			f = isect.bsdf->f(w_out, wi) and computes the contribution as L_light += f * L_i * cos_theta(wi) / pdf. For area 
			lights, it averages the results by dividing by the number of samples. The final result normalizes by the number of
			lights with L_out /= scene->lights.size() and returns the total accumulated radiance L_out.</p>

		<p>Here's some images with uniform hemisphere sampling:</p>

		<p>Uniform hemisphere sampling distributes samples evenly across the hemisphere, ensuring smooth, unbiased lighting, 
			especially in diffuse lighting. While it works well for general illumination, it's inefficient for focused or 
			directional light, as it doesn't prioritize stronger light regions. In contrast, lighting sampling focuses more 
			on areas with higher light intensity, improving efficiency and accuracy in scenes with concentrated light. 
			However, it can introduce noise in darker areas since fewer samples are allocated there. Overall, uniform sampling 
			offers balanced results for general lighting, while lighting sampling excels in capturing strong light sources but 
			may cause noise in low-light regions.
		</p>

		<p>Here's the different renderings of 1, 4, 16, and 64 light rays:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">

						<figcaption>1 light ray</figcaption>

						<img src="bunny_l64.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>64 light rays</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>When comparing noise levels in soft shadows across different light ray samples (1, 4, 16, and 64) using light 
			sampling in a scene with at least one area light and 1 sample per pixel, the results exhibit a clear progression. 
			With just 1 light ray, the shadows are notably noisy, as the limited sampling results in inconsistent shadow 
			transitions, and fine details like soft edges become obscured by grainy artifacts. As the number of light rays 
			increases to 4, the noise in the shadows reduces significantly, though some grain remains visible, especially
			in areas where light transitions are subtler. At 16 rays, the noise levels drop even further, with soft 
			shadows becoming smoother and more defined, showing less fluctuation in light intensity. Finally, with 64 light rays, 
			the shadows are almost entirely free of noise, and the soft shadow transitions appear more natural and precise. This 
			progression highlights how increasing the number of light rays allows for finer light sampling, reducing noise and 
			improving the realism of soft shadows in the rendered scene. </p>

		

		<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
		<p>Implementing the global illumination was very challenging, but very rewarding. Here's how it was implemented:</p>
		<p>The first thing to do was to update the raytrace_pixel function, and make it so that the number of rays' depths is
			max_ray_depth. Next thing to update is est_radiance_global_illuminaton. Given isAccumBounces, I needed to make some 
			conditions based on isAccumBounces. If isAccumBounces is true, set L_out to be adding both the zero_bounce_radiance 
			and at_least_one_bounce_radiance. There's a few checks for when isAccumBounces is false. If depth is 1, set L_out 
			to be only one_bounce_radiance. If depth is 0, L_out is set to zero_bounce_radiance. If depth is greater than 1, 
			L_out is set as at_least_one_bounce_radiance.
		</p>

		<p>The second thing to do is to write the at_least_one_bounce_radiance. For base case handling, the function returns 
			black (0,0,0) if ray depth is 0, which serves as the termination condition for recursion. When ray depth exceeds 0, 
			the function adds one_bounce_radiance if isAccumBounces is true or if this is the first bounce, and returns 
			immediately if ray depth is exactly 1 (representing direct illumination only).
		</p>

		<p>For deeper recursion (ray depth > 1), the implementation employs Russian Roulette with a 70% continuation probability
			to optimize computation. If continuing, it samples a new direction (w_in) using the BSDF, transforms this direction 
			to world space, and creates a new ray from the hit point in the sampled direction. When a BVH intersection is found, 
			the function recursively calls itself and applies the rendering equation by multiplying the recursive result by 
			the BSDF value and cosine term, then dividing by the PDF. Based on isAccumBounces, it either accumulates this 
			result (adding to L_out) or replaces L_out entirely. After that, L_out is returned.
		</p>

		<p>Here's some photos that's rendered with global illumination using 1024 samples per pixel:</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

		</div>

		<p>Here's the bunny rendered with only direct illumination and indirect illumination from left to right: </p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>With only direct illumination, the scene appears sharp and high-contrast, with clear highlights where the light hits 
			and deep, defined shadows in areas that are not lit. This creates a dramatic, but flat, look, as the lighting lacks 
			subtlety and depth. The sharp transitions between light and shadow emphasize the textures and details where the 
			light strikes, but the overall atmosphere feels stark and less natural.</p>

		<p>In contrast, with only indirect illumination, the lighting is much softer and more evenly spread across the scene. 
			Shadows become diffused, with smooth gradients instead of sharp lines, giving the environment a more natural and 
			immersive feel. The lack of direct light makes the scene feel more subtle and balanced, but it loses some of the 
			sharp focus and intensity that direct illumination brings. While the scene feels more cohesive, the absence of 
			highlights means details may not stand out as much.</p>

		<p>Here's the bunny rendered with mth bounce with max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and isAccumBounces=false and
			isAccumBounces=true where false is left and true is right:</p>

		<p>In the 2nd bounce of light, indirect illumination plays a significant role in brightening the scene. The colored 
			wallsâred on the left and blue on the rightâcontribute to global illumination by subtly casting their hues onto 
			the bunny and surrounding surfaces. Since the light has bounced once off the walls and then again onto the objects, 
			the scene exhibits softer shadows and more realistic lighting compared to just direct illumination. In the 3rd bounce
			of light (right image), the scene appears slightly darker due to the diminishing energy of each successive light 
			bounce. However, the effects of color bleeding from the walls become more refined, and global illumination continues
			to enhance the realism of the scene. The differences between the 2nd and 3rd bounces are less drastic than between 
			the 1st and 2nd, but they still contribute to a more natural lighting effect. Compared to rasterization, which only
			considers direct lighting and often relies on approximations like screen-space ambient occlusion for indirect
			effects, ray tracing with multiple bounces provides a far more accurate representation of how light interacts with
			surfaces. The inclusion of these additional bounces is crucial for achieving photorealism, as they capture nuanced 
			lighting effects such as indirect illumination and color bleeding that rasterization methods struggle to replicate.
		</p>

		<p> On the left (isAccumBounces=false), each bounce depth is isolated, while on the right (isAccumBounces=true), 
			bounces build up for more realistic lighting.</p>

		<p>At max_ray_depth = 0, both sides are black due to no light reaching surfaces. With depth = 1, direct lighting 
			appears, but only accumulated bounces introduce realistic indirect lighting as depth increases. The left side 
			remains darker and less realistic, while the right side captures indirect illumination, colored reflections from 
			walls, and softer shadows. By depth = 5, the accumulated version closely resembles physically accurate global 
			illumination, demonstrating the importance of multiple light bounces for realism.</p>

		<p>When comparing rendered views of a scene with various sample-per-pixel (SPP) rates, including 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 
			and 1024, using 4 light rays per pixel, I observed a clear progression in image quality and rendering time. At 1 
			SPP, the image is extremely noisy, with each pixel only sampled once, resulting in high variance and poor overall 
			quality. As I increased to 2 and 4 SPP, the noise begins to reduce noticeably, but the image still appears grainy.
			 At 8 and 16 SPP, there's a significant improvement in image quality, with much smoother transitions and clearer 
			 details emerging. The jump to 64 SPP brings us close to a visually pleasing result, with most of the noise 
			 eliminated and fine details becoming sharp and clear. Finally, at 1024 SPP, there is a near-perfect, 
			 photorealistic image with virtually no visible noise. However, it's important to note that the rendering time 
			 increases exponentially with higher SPP values. The use of 4 light rays per pixel ensures that even at lower SPP 
			 rates, some global illumination effects are captured, contributing to the overall realism of the scene. 
			 This comparison highlights the trade-off between image quality and rendering efficiency, with most practical 
			 applications finding a sweet spot around 16 to 64 SPP for a balance of quality and reasonable rendering times.

		<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
		<p>Adaptive sampling is a technique used to optimize rendering performance by allocating more computational resources 
			to complex or noisy parts of an image while using fewer samples in areas that converge quickly. This approach 
			significantly improves efficiency compared to uniform sampling.</p>
		<p>To implement adaptive sampling, I initialize some variables, like the maximum number of samples per pixel, pixel
			origin coordinates, a Vector3D sum for color values, s1 and s2, which are the statistical accumulators for luminance, 
			and a counter for actual samples used.</p>
		<p>The main sampling loop then takes samples up to the maximum allowed number, periodically checking convergence after 
			processing batches of samples. During convergence testing, the mean luminance is calculated from all samples 
			collected so far, along with the variance using the formula (1/(n-1)) * (s2 - s1Â²/n). A 95% confidence interval is 
			computed using 1.96 * sqrt(variance/n) and compared against a tolerance threshold. If the confidence interval is 
			small enough relative to the mean (I &lt;= maxTolerance * mean), sampling can stop early. </p>
		<p>For each sample, the process involves generating a sample position within the pixel using a grid sampler, converting 
			the sample to normalized coordinates, generating a camera ray, and tracing it through the scene to get radiance. 
			The statistical accumulators are updated with each sample: s1 is incremented by the sample luminance, s2 by the 
			sample luminance squared, and pixel_sum by the full color sample. Finally, the average color is calculated from all
			samples, the pixel is updated in the sample buffer, and the number of samples used is recorded in a separate buffer.
